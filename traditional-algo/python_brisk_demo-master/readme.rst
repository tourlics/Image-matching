Quick Usage
===========
    python brisk_demo.py


Introduction
============
As an inexperienced opencv user, getting feature detection/description working
in python took some time. Then I realized that SIFT / SURF / everything that
has some scale invariance in OpenCV was encumbered with patents. With
BRISK / FREAK, now there are viable (or better) alternatives.

I hope this example helps anyone else who wants to get started in python with
feature detection.
